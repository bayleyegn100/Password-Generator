## Project Title: Modifying a starter javascript code to generate a random password with a given criteria
### Motivation
Although a rapidly increasing online business has abundant importance and benefit to the users it has its own limitation. Nowadays there are a lot of hackers. 
So to place ourselves away from them it is better to have a strong password and changing them in a timely manner when necessary. I hope the code that I modified will help the user to generate
a password and they can change it when necessary.


### Actions were taken to address the problem
Based on the demands and criteria of the employees I tried to incorporate the elements and characteristics indicated by them. To address their request I go through the starter code
and try to sketch the processes to be followed during the modification of the code. The modification started by figuring out the missing elements and work on them to fill out. In that context
I started by assigning the variables, developing the prompt functions and codings, and ending with writing the codes to generate a password. I tried them by opening in a browser to cross-check the functionality of the application. The application is published at https://bayleyegn100.github.io/Password-Generator/ and you can push your comment to advance the code

### Lesson Learned
The importance Of javascript to reach the html.
